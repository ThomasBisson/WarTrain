# WarTrain
This project was made during the event GamJam. Our team of 5 persons had 3 days to code a game with the theme "A spy during the WW2".
It's a 3D game where you embody a spy during WW2 and your goal is to stop a train in direction of Germany. It was made using Unity  2017.3.0f3.
I can't import all the project because it's too big for GitHub but you can play the game if you want.

How to run the game :

    -Clone it
    
    -Look into the directory Salty_Corp_Data and find the file sharedassets1.assets.rar
    
    -Copie the file inside to the directory Salty_Corp_Data
    
    -Delete sharedassets1.assets.rar
    
    -Run the Salty_Corp.exe file
    
    -Enjoy our game ! :)
